### Project Summary

This system uses *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* to detect hand gestures and map them to media control commands (play, pause, volume, etc.). A camera captures real-time video input, which the CNN classifies into specific gestures to enable *contactless control*.

### Tools & Technologies

- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- OpenCV / Python
- Webcam for real-time capture

### Key Features

- High accuracy gesture recognition
- Real-time interaction
- User-friendly interface
- Suitable for hygienic/public environments

### Applications

- Smart homes
- Hospitals and clean-room operations
- Hands-free systems
