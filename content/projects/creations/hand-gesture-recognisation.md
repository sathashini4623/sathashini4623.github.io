AI Powered Hand Gesture Recognition for Touchless Desktop Control
==================================================================

### Project Summary

This project presents a *vision-based hand gesture recognition system* designed to enable *touchless desktop interaction*. It allows users to perform common computer functions—such as cursor movement, clicking, scrolling, and adjusting volume/brightness—by interpreting hand gestures captured via a webcam.

### Tools & Technologies Used

- *Mediapipe*: For real-time hand landmark detection.
- *OpenCV*: For video processing and image manipulation.
- *PyAutoGUI*: To automate system controls based on gestures.
- *Python*: Primary language for implementation.
- *Jupyter Notebook / Anaconda*: Development environment.

### System Modules

- *Hand Tracking*: Tracks fingertip and joint landmarks using Mediapipe.
- *Image Processing*: Optimizes webcam input for gesture detection.
- *Gesture Recognition*: Calculates Euclidean distances to interpret gestures.
- *Control Automation*: Executes corresponding system actions (click, scroll, etc.).
- *User Interface*: Provides live visual feedback with drawn landmarks.

### Key Features

- Cursor navigation through index finger movement.
- Click, right-click, and double-click based on finger proximity.
- Scrolling using vertical hand gestures.
- Volume and brightness adjustment through pinch gestures.
- Real-time responsiveness and visual feedback.

### Use Cases

- Ideal for hygienic environments like healthcare.
- Enhances accessibility for users with physical limitations.
- Useful for public or shared computing systems.
- Can be extended for gesture-based smart home or media control.
